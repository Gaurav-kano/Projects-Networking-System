//Contributions Handled : Graph Theory : Maahir Sharma
//Functionalities as of now:
//1) Setting up Router Networks with Edges
//2) Calculation of Routing Tables via Bellmann Ford Algorithm in O(N^2);
//3) Finding the Maximal Strongly Connected Sub Network via KosaRaju Algorithm.
//4) Handling Link Failiure of between any two network routers with a direct edge.
//5) Added Link State Packet and Flooding Feature so that when flood occurs each router has access to LSP of the flood initiator.
/*6) Added Optimal Cell Tower Placement Map is likened to a color,(channelâ€“colors are limited to four), and found where to economically position broadcast towers

  A smaller (or equal) sequence number would imply an LSP older (or not newer) than the one stored, so it would be discarded and no further action would be needed.
